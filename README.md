This package processes SDO data to recover trends in the center-to-limb
variability of the solar radial velocity. v1.0.x is described in Palumbo et al.
(in prep.). The results of this paper can be reproduced using the [showyourwork workflow](https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork) from [this repo](https://github.com/palumbom/sdo-clv).
